[Student] Sir, it would depend on what marks I get.
[Teacher] Ok, so what have you planned if you secured good marks in matric?
[Student] I will haunt pre-medical groups in F.S.C. Otherwise, I shall join I.C.S.
[Teacher] Why did you deem medical groups?

[Student] I think that several people die due to inadequate medical aid. They cannot afford substantial medical costs. I shall help them without exerting any charges.
[Teacher] Your statements are false because each student shows pity first, but does not work upon his promise and grows materialistic.
[Student1] I would not be in that evil group. My grandmother was very ill, and we could not get here appropriately treated because we were destitute. My purpose in life is to be a doctor, and I shall serve the people as a good citizen and help the needy free of cost.
[Teacher] Ok, then. Hope You will get succeeded in your life.
[Student2] Thank you, sir.
